Through the world&#39;s Top100 computing power public chain-BHP, the transaction data of computing power assets can be managed on BHP&#39;s public chain.</span></p><p class="p2" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: rgb(13, 13, 20); min-height: 15px; white-space: normal;"><span class="s1" style="font-kerning: none;"></span><br/></p><p class="p3" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: rgb(13, 13, 20); white-space: normal;"><span class="s1" style="font-kerning: none;">In 2019, RRMine began to look toward the world. On one hand, RRMine launched the first cross-chain settlement system. On the other hand, RRMine upgraded to 2.0 and introduced computing power assets into the secondary market. Cloud computing power contracts can be traded between RRMine users. Subsequently, RRMine embarked on a journey of global expansion, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Taipei, Frankfurt, London, and Las Vegas.</span></p><p class="p2" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: rgb(13, 13, 20); min-height: 15px; white-space: normal;"><span class="s1" style="font-kerning: none;"></span><br/></p><p class="p3" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: rgb(13, 13, 20); white-space: normal;"><span class="s1" style="font-kerning: none;">In 2020, RRMine began to provide SaaS services to third parties and began to launch IPFS computing power products. It took only 4 months to go from zero to the top 10 of the global Filecoin rankings. The Filecoin ming mechanism is completely different from BTC, and it is not easy to achieve. This not only required a lot of hard work but also based on the RRMine&#39;s technical experiences to finally achieved such an amazing goal.</span></p><p class="p2" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: rgb(13, 13, 20); min-height: 15px; white-space: normal;"><span class="s1" style="font-kerning: none;"></span><br/></p><p class="p3" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: rgb(13, 13, 20); white-space: normal;"><span class="s1" style="font-kerning: none;">IPFS is currently the focus of the market.

Whenever there is data, there is a need for storage. As the amount of data increases, the demand for data storage will rise in the future. As the infrastructure of multiple emerging strategic industries, the demand for data storage will be greater. As long as any downstream industries are still expanding in scale, demand will not shrink. IPFS is the leading project in the cloud storage track. The decentralized ecology of the Filecoin mainnet and its incentive layer has laid the foundation for creating a market around storing and retrieving data. We are very optimistic about its innovation and development potential.</span></p><p class="p2" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: rgb(13, 13, 20); min-height: 15px; white-space: normal;"><span class="s1" style="font-kerning: none;"></span><br/></p><p class="p3" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: rgb(13, 13, 20); white-space: normal;"><span class="s1" style="font-kerning: none;"><strong>Q: What do you think of the current design of the Filecoin economic model?</strong></span></p><p class="p3" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: rgb(13, 13, 20); white-space: normal;"><span class="s1" style="font-kerning: none;"><strong>A</strong>: The current economic model requires both staking and lock-up, which does put a certain pressure on miners.

The underlying computing power is actually technical services, which directly affect digital currency, data, and digitization of physical assets. So with the development of the digital economy, there is huge room for growth in the computing power market. Compared with centralized computing power, it generates innovative liquidity and will further explore the market.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;background:white;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size: 17px;font-family:&#39;Arial&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;;border:none windowtext 1px;padding:0">In fact, the economic model behind is very innovative and is a stable mechanism and matching mechanism. In simple terms, after up to another level, the digital economy is able to further allocate market resources and make existing computing power capabilities to play a greater role. On the one hand, it reduces the cost of the current market suppliers. On the other hand, it reduces the users’ entry threshold. Therefore, real Web 3.0 is a digital economy. Compared with the traditional Internet model, it is very light assets.</span></p><p style="text-align:left;background:white;vertical-align:baseline"><span style="font-size: 17px;font-family:&#39;Arial&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;;border:none windowtext 1px;padding:0">This model is actually an opportunity for disruptive innovation for the current economic environment.
